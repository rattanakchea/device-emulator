# device-emulator
This simple application allow you to change the skin for different devices: Android Phone, iPhone and iPad, and scale proportionally to device width and height.

**Why I made it?**
I was looking for a fast and easy way to display my image in a device frame (iPhone or Android), but I was not able to find one.

Therefore, I made this little application to allow to easily do this task.

**Usage**
For now, you would need to copy or link to the `main.css` file and assign correct id to the html elements.
It might be appropriate to create an Angular Directive for this task.

Feel free to fork and add extra features.
